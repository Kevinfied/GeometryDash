## Description
##### RUN ControlCenter.java TO START GAME LOL <<<<-------------------

Geometry Dash is a rhythm-based side scroller. There are maps that the player can play. In each map, the player is to
pass all the obstacles to get to the end of the map. 

<br/>
There is only one type of input. The gamemode that the player is in decides what that input does.

Cube: Press to jump <br/>
Ship: Press to fly upward, let go to fall down

In our game, there are three levels, in order of increasing difficulty:
<br/>
Stereo Madness<br/>
Base After Base<br/>
Jumper<br/>

The main objects are the spikes and solids. Solids are safe as long as you do not crash into it. Spikes kill the player
on contact. <br/>
There are also portals that can either switch the player's gamemode or change the player's gravity. <br/>
Pads boosts the player up upon contact and orbs gives a boost if the player taps while colliding with it.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a practice mode in which the player can manually set checkpoints. While practice mode is activated, whenever the player crashes, they will start
from the newest checkpoint.
