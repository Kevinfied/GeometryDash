your brain is too heavy for me to carry kevin,<br/>
it can reallly lighten my load if you use it<br/>
...to do work<br/>
against the downward force of gravity that is pulling me down to my grave<br/>
i'm diene<br/>
also my back hurts,<br/>
from carrying you<br/>
seriously, it actually hurt not just figuratively<br/>
